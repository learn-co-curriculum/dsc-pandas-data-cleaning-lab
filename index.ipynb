    "# Pandas Data Cleaning - Cumulative Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, we'll make use of everything we've learned about pandas, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis. In order to complete this lab, you'll have to import, clean, combine, reshape, and visualize data to answer questions provided, as well as your own questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "- Practice opening and inspecting the contents of CSVs using pandas dataframes\n",
    "- Practice identifying and handling missing values\n",
    "- Practice identifying and handling invalid values\n",
    "- Practice cleaning text data by removing whitespace and fixing typos\n",
    "- Practice joining multiple dataframes"

    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "In this lab, we'll work with a version of the comprehensive Superheroes Dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set/data) and was originally scraped from [SuperHeroDb](https://www.superherodb.com/). We have modified the structure and contents of the dataset somewhat for the purposes of this lab.  Note that this data was collected in June 2017, so it may not reflect the most up-to-date superhero lore.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is contained in two separate CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `heroes_information.csv`: each record represents a superhero, with attributes of that superhero (e.g. eye color). Height is measured in centimeters, and weight is measured in pounds.\n",
    "2. `super_hero_powers.csv`: each record represents a superpower, then has True/False values representing whether each superhero has that power\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The business questions you have been provided are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the distribution of superheroes by publisher?\n",
    "2. What is the relationship between height and number of superpowers? And does this differ based on gender?\n",
    "3. What are the 5 most common superpowers in Marvel Comics vs. DC Comics?\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab also simulates something you are likely to encounter at some point or another in your career in data science: someone has given you access to a dataset, as well as a few questions, and has told you to \"find something interesting\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in addition to completing the basic data cleaning tasks and the aggregation and reshaping tasks needed to answer the provided questions, you will also need to formulate a question of your own and perform any additional cleaning/aggregation/reshaping that is needed to answer it."

    "#### 1. Load the Data with Pandas\n",

    "Create a dataframes `heroes_df` and `powers_df` that represent the two CSV files. Use pandas methods to inspect the shape and other attributes of these dataframes.\n",

    "In order to answer this question, you will need to:\n",

    "* Identify and handle missing values\n",
    "* Identify and handle text data requiring cleaning\n",

    "#### 3. Perform Data Aggregation and Cleaning Required to Answer Second Question\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question is: *What is the relationship between height and number of superpowers? And does this differ based on gender?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer this question, you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Join the dataframes together\n",
    "* Identify and handle invalid values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Perform Data Aggregation Required to Answer Third Question\n",
    "\n",
    "The third question is: *What are the 5 most common superpowers in Marvel Comics vs. DC Comics?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This should not require any additional data cleaning or joining of tables, but it will require some additional aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Formulate and Answer Your Own Question\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is fairly open-ended. Think of a question that can be answered with the available data, and perform any cleaning or aggregation required to answer that question."

    "One of the trickier tasks in data cleaning is identifying invalid or impossible values. In these cases, you have to apply your domain knowledge rather than any particular computational technique. For example, if you were looking at data containing dates of past home sales, and one of those dates was 100 years in the future, pandas wouldn't flag that as an issue, but you as a data scientist should be able to identify it.\n",
    "\n",
